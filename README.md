# Data Ingestion for Azure Purview
# Business Overview
Purview is a single data governance solution from Azure that lets you manage and
regulate one's data across on-premises, multi-cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS)
environments. With automated data discovery, sensitive data categorization, and
end-to-end data lineage, one can create a holistic, up-to-date map of data
environment. It allows data curators to manage and safeguard their data estates and
data consumers to locate important reliable data.
By delivering data scanning and categorization as a service for assets throughout the
data estate, Azure Purview automates data discovery. Metadata and descriptions of
data assets identified are combined into a comprehensive map of your data estate.
There are purpose-built apps above this map that enable data discovery, access
management, and data landscape analytics environments.
Data Map makes data more meaningful by visualizing the data assets and their
interactions throughout the data estate. The data map is used to find information and
control who has access.
Data Catalog helps identify reliable data sources by exploring and searching
data assets. The data catalog identifies data sources by aligning the assets with
business terminology and data classification.
Data Insights provide a snapshot of the data estate, allowing one to see what kind of
data  they have and where it is stored.
# Data Pipeline
A data pipeline is a technique for transferring data from one system to another. The data
may or may not be updated, and it may be handled in real-time (or streaming) rather
than in batches. The data pipeline encompasses everything from harvesting or
acquiring data using various methods to storing raw data, cleaning, validating, and
transforming data into a query-worthy format, displaying KPIs, and managing the above
process.
# Agenda
This project is the first part of a two projects series. This project will focus on data
ingestion and preparation for Azure Purview using Azure Logic Apps, Azure Storage
Account, Azure Data Factory, and Azure SQL Databases. The next project focuses on
data consumption and analysis using Azure Purview.
